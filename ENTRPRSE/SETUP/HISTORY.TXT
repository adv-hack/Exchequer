Setup.Dll Version History
===========================

25/01/99  HM   Added MemoryMapping functions for new Single CD
   -           licencing.

26/11/98  HM   Modified to use the NT friendly registry object
               in the SetScalableSQL and GetLastEntDir functions.

16/09/98  HM   Added SetScalableSQL function for ODBC Setup to
               initialize the Scalable SQL Settings for ODBC. 

14/08/98  MH   Modified the directory dialog so that when adding a
               new company it doesn't check for MCOMPMAN.SYS. This 
               will now be added as required by the setup program.

06/08/98  MH   Modified the directory dialog to have a Find button
               on various options which pops up a dialog allowing
               a specified drive to be searched for Enterprise 
               systems.

               Added an GetLastEntDir function for the Setup
               Programs which reads the LastDir from the
               Registry and returns it after checking its a 
               valid directory.

24/06/98  MH   Added Workstation Configuration dialog as it was the
               only place to put it. 32-bit dLL only.

27/11/97  MH   Modifed GetEnterDir for mode 'v' - Customisation - 
               Enterprise Installation.

13/11/97  MH   Modifed GetEnterDir to stop people selecting the root
               directory (eg. C: or C:\). This caused Enterprise to
               crash because Btrieve doesn't seem to like it.

25/09/97  MH   Modifed GetEnterDir for the Connectivity Kit.

09/09/97  MH   Modified GetEnterDir to check the currency version
               of the destination system is correct for the CD.
               Affects Upgrades, Add Company, Register, Workstation
               Installs.

27/06/97  MH   Modified function declaration for WISE from CDECL to
               STDCALL on advicce of Wise Tech support. This was 
               because they were crashing the While loop in the setup
               script.

23/05/97  MH   Modified ValidOK on TDirectoryDialog because it wasn't
               checking for an existing system when doing an install.
               Changed to ask for confirmation if it detects data.

19/03/97  MH   Moved from C:\Develop\Install to X:\Entrprse\Setup

10/02/97  MH   Mods
               ====
               Changed the directory dialog to accept directories with
               <= 0 bytes of free disk space, as large drives can cause
               -ve numbers to be returned. 

               Changed the directory dialog to check that the first
               letter of the path is 'c'..'z' and the second letter
               is ':'. this will stop the '\\nt_server\c drive...'
               paths being used.
