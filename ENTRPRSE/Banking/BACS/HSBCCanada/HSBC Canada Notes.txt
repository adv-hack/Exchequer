The following values should be set in the ini file:

UserID	This is the 10-digit EFT Originator ID provided by HSBC
FileNo	File Create Number. This starts at 1 and is incremented each time a file is created. As there is a maximum of 4 digits it resets once it reaches 10000. I don't know how this will work with HSBC since the spec says "Exch file must contain a creation number that is greater than that of previously transmitted files." - something missing there.
DebitCPA	The CPA code to be used for Debit files. Defaults to 700
CreditCPA	The CPA code to be used for Credit files. Defaults to 450
