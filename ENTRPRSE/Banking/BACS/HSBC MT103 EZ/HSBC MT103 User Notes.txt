HSBC MT103 Eurozone format

As the eurozone format uses BIC and IBAN codes, supplier bank details should be set up as follows:

The Sort Code field should contain the BIC (8 or 11 chars)

The IBAN can be up to 34 characters in length, so the first 20 characters should be put in the Bank A/C field, with the remaining characters in the Bank Ref field. No other information should be put in either of these fields.

The User Bank Details (in System Setup for a stand-alone plugin, or in Bank Account details for eBanking) should be the standard UK Sort Code and Account number.

The HSBC MT103 Priority Payment format uses standard UK Sort Codes and Account numbers.
