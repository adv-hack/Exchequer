                          Changed SendEntFax in RWPrintR to set the Print Job Title as this was 
                          preventing the Fax Client from correctly identifying the job, so it
                          always asked for the Fax Details.

                         Modified the Input Fields to return 3 digit years from Periods
                         and the Indexing to use 3 digit years because it was previously
                         assuming 2 digits which was OK until the year 2000! At this point
                         the period indexes failed miserably reporting no records because 
                         the year was taken as 10 not 100 and the period was picking up the 
                         3rd digit of the year.

                         Modified the Fast Indexing and Select_Records 
                         routines to save/restore the record positions
                         as Bentley's were having major problems with
                         a simple list of transaction lines.

                         Fixed a bug in the Find_FastNDX routine where
                         CheckKey was converting the key to uppercase
                         before checking it, this caused an invalid
                         folio number to be considered valid - what
                         were the odds on that???

                         Modified the Report Export function as it was
                         corrupting the key of Nominal Lines by removing
                         VarType from the ReportKey field. This caused
                         lines to be moved to the end when edited as the
                         key was being fixed.

                         Also seemed to be causing problems with the 
                         printing as formulae were being reported as incorrect.

                         just to cause a break.

                         Modified the summary breaking to keep track of 
                         whether a line has been printed within a break,
                         so it can intelligently print the break lines.
                         This was previously causing large blank areas
                         to be printed when using the select on summary

                         it fails to link to other records. This was
                         causing problems on invoice description lines
                         as it was remembering the previous stock items 
                         details.

                         Also modified Job Actuals to link to the invoices
                         customer/supplier.

                         Modified the line objects to automatically round
                         the amounts to the correct decimals for the column.

                         for Nominal Transfers. The key was incorrectly
                         using LineNo instead of AbsLineNo.

                         Added new field THDATEP2 - Date Paid (Blank) as
                         the existing THDATEPY field was setting it to
                         the Transaction Date incorrectly.

                       Modified the parser to allow it to automatically

                       Changed the LinkOtherdb function in DicLink2U to
                       reset the relational records for detail lines
                       without headers. These lines have a zero folio
                       number and a mod was done for the Form Designer
                       to not reset the records if the folio was zero,
                       this was necessary for transactions with no lines.

                       Sharp which caused a GPF (not repeated). If

       16/10/97        Modified Match_WildChar in RepObj2U to check all
                       the characters in an R4 = "JUB" test. Previously
                       it would only check the number of characters in
                       R4, so if R4 = "J" or "JU" it would pass.
                       
                       Changed Format_Field in RepObj2U to support Blank
                       If 0 columns.
                       
                       Changed RepSetTabs to Right justify blank columns
                       unless 2nd character justification used, see below.

                       Modified GetColWidths to support Blank Justification
                       through the use of the 2nd character ie. BL, BC, BR.
                       
                       Modified the Report Tree to stop a GPF when editing
                       a report. If you did something during the edit to 
                       cause the report tree to reload and then editted again
                       the report tree gpf'd because it was keeping a handle
                       to the edit node which was destroyed by the reload.

                       Modified the Nominal Field entry to allow blank formulae,
                       this allows narrative lines tobe added like in Exch RW.
                       
                       Modified the Print Preview window for Auto-Maximise which
                       was commented out.
                       
                       Modified Format_Field in RepObj2U to not trim the spaces 
                       off of fields. This was causing problems with real numbers
                       in right aligned columns where +ve numbers were having there
                       padding space taken off.
                       
                       Modified JACOST (13009) to be signed.
                       
                       Added Line Type Total fields to invoice:

                         THLNTOT1  2080  Transaction Line Type 1 Total
                         THLNTOT2  2081  Transaction Line Type 2 Total

                         THLNTOT4  2083  Transaction Line Type 4 Total

                       DicLinkU changed because THGOODSZ and THGOODSE,
                       and THVATZ and THVATE were added to the data
                       dictionary the wrong way around. The meant that
                       Z was reporting E values, and vicey versa.

                       Added Layout Report for Technical Support.

                       tabbing off it didn't register the changes. OK 
                       button now sets focus to itself for those fields
                       and the change of focus fixes the problem.

                       Currency fields cause a range check error if you

                       Modified GetInpField in RepObjIU to trim any spaces off the
                       end of the input fields. This fixes a bug in record selection
                       caused by R? fields being trimmed and I? fields not being
                       trimmed when comparing codes (e.g. Stock Code, Job Code, CC
                       Code, ...)

                       Modified DicLinkU for Heinz :- Def_InvCalc is changing the
                       Discount totals on the invoice because of rounding errors.
                       As the result of the function is put in global arrays we
                       can save and restore the invoice record to get around the
                       problem.

                       report, but cancel at the print dialog, the thread controller

                       the report line list double-click a different line. When you
                       save the original line in the edit dialog it overwrites the
                       second line. Fixed in report, nominal, input lines.

                       DL's TB - Trial Balance report crashes with a Range Check Error
                       or and Application Error. Traced it to SendText in ReportO when
                       it is printing blank columns. Only seems to happen for 5th column
                       on one particular line, but fixed anyway by stopping it printing 
                       blank columns. This possible fixes the visible problem and not
                       the actual problem.
