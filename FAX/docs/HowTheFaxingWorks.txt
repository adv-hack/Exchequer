When running enterprise ecomms the faxing works as follows...


FAXBTRV.DLL
-----------

1. When you send a fax in enterprise it first calls the function "OpenFaxFileWithPath" in 
FAXBTRV.DLL. It passes in the path to open the file from - I assume this path is aquired
from the enterprise system setup.

2. The Function "GetUniqueRef" is then called to get the number to be entered in the 
FaxDocName (e.g. 00000G). "Exchequer Enterprise Fax" is then appended to the end of this
number to create the FaxDocName.

3. "InsertFaxDetails" is now called. This adds a record into FAXES.DAT which includes such
details as : The name of the print job which we will be giving to the printer driver when
we actually go to print this fax.

4. "CloseFaxFile" is now called which closes FAXES.DAT.

Note : The FAXBTRV.DLL that is used, comes from the DIR specified in the general settings. 
e.g. something like c:\excheqr\entrprse\faxsrv.


FAXCLNT.EXE
-----------

1. The Next thing that happens is that Enterprise says "Print the fax".

2. The event "ApdFaxDriverDocStart" now fires. This appears to happen BEFORE any printing
to the driver happens.

3. In "ApdFaxDriverDocStart" we check to see if the server is running, if it is not we will 
pop-up a message (only the first time).

4. We now define the filename that we are going to use for this fax (sequentially numbered)
so we can have a link between the database record, and the APF filename.

5. We now Check to see if there is a record in the database which has the same name as
ApdFaxDriver.DocName. This should be found if you are faxing from enterprise. If the record 
in the database could not be found, then we pop-up a dialog asking where to send the fax.

Note : In Windows 2000 it changes the name of the print job. Therefore, when we go to look 
for it, it isn't there, so it pops-up the Fax Info dialog.

6. The event "ApdFaxDriverDocEnd" is now fired. This happens immediately after the fax has 
been printed to the driver.


Now there is an entry in the database pointing to an APF filename, so that the sender can 
find the fax and send it.
