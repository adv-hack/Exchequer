Hello Mike, I would just like to describe to you the faxing problem that we are having with 
Windows 2000, so that we are all straight on what we are looking at here.

Firstly we have 3 programs involved in this operation

	1. Enterprise - Our accounting system that the users sends the faxes from.
	
	2. Fax Client - An EXE that needs to be running all the time.
	
	3. Fax Sender - An EXE to send the faxes.

The fax sender is normally on a separate machine on the network. Each user that wants
to send faxes, must be running Enterprise and the Fax Client.


The process that works fine on Windows 95 / 98 / NT machines is as follows :

1. The User says "Send A Fax" in Enterprise
2. A unique name for the print job is created (e.g. "00000A Enterprise Fax").
3. The details of the fax job (The Name, the fax number, the Unique Job Name etc.) 
are stored as a record in a database by Enterprise. 
4. Enterprise says "Print this Job" - Passing in the Unique Job Name.

5. The Fax Client will then leap into action, activated by the "OnDocStart" event of a
"TApdFaxDriverInterface" component. 
6. The Fax Client can then find the previously created database record using the Unique 
Job Name which comes into the "OnDocStart" event as ApdFaxDriverInterface.DocName.
7. A unique filename will now be calculated for the APF file (e.g. 00000007.APF), the
ApdFaxDriverInterface.FileName will then be set to it, and the Unique Filename will be 
held in the database against the record for this fax.

8. After the printing is complete, we will now have the APF file where we want it, and an 
entry in the database which matches the APF filename containing all the information we 
need to send the fax.
9. The Fax Sender now periodically polls the directory for new files, finds their entry in
the database and sends each fax, using the details held in the database.

Phew !

Now, the problem occurs in Windows 2000 on step 6 of the above. What you will find is that
Windows 2000 changes the names of the print jobs, even though we have specified the Unique
Job Name that we want the job to be created as. This will then mean that on step 6, 
ApdFaxDriverInterface.DocName will not be set to our Unique Job Name. It can therefore not 
find the details of the fax in the database, because we use this Unique Job Name to find 
the details. 
This means that we cannot modify the database record to add in the Unique APF filename. So
although we can get the APF filename created in the correct place, we have lost the link
between the file and the database record, so the fax sender cannot find any faxes to send.

Can you think of anything that we can do, to get around this problem ?

A Suggested solution was to change the piece of code that fires the "OnDocStart" event to
check another mechanism first. For instance, if before firing the event, you checked a 
registy entry to get the new filename, then we could populate the registy entry before 
printing each fax. If the registy entry exists it would not fire the event, if it did not 
exist then the event would trigger as usual. What do you think ?

If you have any queries regarding this matter, don't hesitate to contact me.

Neil Frewer.
