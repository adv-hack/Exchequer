This file summarizes changes made between Async Professional 4.02
and 4.03

APRO 4.03 contains fixes for the problems reported shortly after the
APRO 4.02 release.  APRO 4.02 was removed from distribution due to 
the severity of these problems. The changes listed below include the
changes made for APRO 4.02 as well as those made for APRO 4.03.  Due
to the extent of some of these changes, the change text below for
4.03 will be somewhat more detailed than usual.

Also, while addressing the general problems, we took this opportunity
to concentrate on the TAdTerminal and fix the known bugs with that 
component.  


APRO 4.03:
Bugs Fixed
---------------------------------------------------------------------
General
  - Several areas where an AV could occur were fixed.  These were
    primarily related to the 4.02 dispatcher changes that changed
    the timing of the APW_PORTCLOSE messages. Several APRO components
    used the APW_PORTCLOSE notification (which was being sent when
    the port started to close) to begin their cleanup; the 4.02
    change sent that notification once the port was actually closed.
    Components that referenced the port's dispatcher directly caused
    the AV because the dispatcher was already destroyed.  The fix
    for this includes adding RegisterUserCallbackEx, RegisterUserEx
    and DeregisterUserCallbackEx methods to the TApdCustomComPort,
    and support for the new TPortCallbackEx method pointer.

Terminal
  - AV when terminal does not have 24 lines and adding an emulator 
  - Terminal has scrollback/highlighting problems 

Fax
  - ResetAPJPartials doesn't reset Recipient's AttemptNum 

SAPI
  - Not able to use phone optimized engine in Windows 98 




Enhancements Made
---------------------------------------------------------------------  
Terminal
  - Added TAdTerminal.MouseSelect property, determines whether the 
    mouse can be used to select text in the terminal window
