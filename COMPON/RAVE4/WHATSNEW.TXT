                         http://www.nevrona.com

4.05 - 8/14/01
--------------
- Fixed several bugs in scripting.  To use scripting follow these steps:

  1: Select the component that you want to define an event for.  In this case,
  select a TRaveText component.

  2: Click on the Event Editor tab and select an event to define in the
  Available Events drop down.  In this case select OnGetText.

  3: In the editor panel, type the source code for your event.  In this case
  type in "Value := 'Hello Printer';" without the double quotes.  When you are
  done typing, press the Compile button and if everything compiled run your
  report to see the results.

- Fixed problems with the build process that was causing errors in the Rave
  IDE during shutdown and when saving files (for version 4.04 only).

4.04 - 7/19/01
--------------
