========== COMMON ==========
If you used freeware version (0.5), read the section
in the end of this file.

If you have another version of RichView Package installed,
you need to delete (archive) it.
If older version remains in paths where Delphi/C++Builder
searches for components, you will not be able to compile/run
your applications with RichView properly.

Below are the instructions how to install components, 
how to run demos, how to integrate help into IDE. 
(Help file is integrated with more or less completeness, 
 depending on version of Delphi/C++Builder)

In registered version, components are in the the root directory of installation.
In trial versions, components are in the locations specified below.


========== Installing Update ======
Copy updated files to the same directory as older version (override older files)
Then follow instructions for your version of Delphi/C++Builder (choose "Compile"
instead of "Install" for updates).
Do not forget to rebuild packages!
Read about compatibility issues (if any) in Readme.txt


========== Delphi 3 ==========

INSTALLING COMPONENTS
IMPORTANT: 
(=problem description=) 
  There is a problem in Delphi 3 with packages 
which use jpeg.dcu unit (as RVPkgD3.dpk does).
Jpeg unit is not included in any package by default. 
If some package uses this unit, this unit is included in it implicitly. 
When second package tries to use it, Delphi says that jpeg unit 
is already implicitly contained in the first package, and does not want 
to install the second one. 
Moreover, when such thing happens, you will not be able to install 
second package any more, even if you set correct dependencies manually 
(you will need to delete all compilation result files for packages 
manually, or install a new package under a new name).
(=what to do=)
The recommended way is to create a new package with jpeg unit, install it and 
specify that all packages which use jpeg unit require this package.
(a)If you have no third-party packages which use jpeg unit, 
  first open JpegD3.dpk package from D3 directory of RichView 
  (menu "File|Open") and click "Install" button in the package window 
  (this package contains only standart jpeg unit).
  Open RVPkgD3.dpk (menu "File|Open") and click "Install" button in
  the package window. 
  You can see what this package requires JpegD3 package 
  (click on "Requires" tab on package window).
  Repeat the steps above with RVDBPkgD3.dpk.
(b)If you have third-party package which already uses jpeg unit, please
 - uninstall this package 
   (menu "Component|Install Packages",
   select this package and click "Remove" button)
 - install JpegD3.dpk (see above)
 - open these old packages and make them to require JpegD3 package 
   (click on "Requires" tab in the package window, then click "Add" 
   button in the toolbar and add JpegD3.dcp from D3 directory of RichView
 - install RVPkgD3.dpk (see above)
 - if your version of Delphi supports database components, 
   install RVDBPkgD3.dpk.
INSTALLING HELP
 - Copy RichView.hlp and RichView.cnt to HELP directory of Delphi
 - Open Delphi3.cfg in HELP directory of Delphi, and add line:
:Link RichView.hlp
 - Open Delphi3.cnt in HELP directory of Delphi 
  (it's possible that you'll need to use wordpad or other text editor 
   without file size limitation), and add two lines: 
:Include RichView.cnt
:Index RichView=RichView.hlp
 - delete all *.gid files from HELP directory of Delphi (these files are hidden!)

===== FOR USERS OF FREEWARE VERSION (0.5): =====

You can't use both freeware and shareware version
on the same Delphi or C++Builder instance.
If you have the old freeware version, please uninstall it
before installing the shareware one (and remove it from 
directories where Delphi/C++Builder searches for 
components).
You can try your existing projects with this version 
of RichView, but read "Compatibility with older versions 
of RichView" topic of RichView help before. Please save 
original code of these projects (old freeware version 
could not be able to load projects saved with new one, 
and you can decide to return to old version).
