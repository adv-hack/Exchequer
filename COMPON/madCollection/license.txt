LGPL ICONS USED IN MADEXCEPT
----------------------------
The madExcept settings dialog uses some icons taken from the Nuvola icon theme
created by David Vignoni (www.icon-king.com). These icons are released under
the LGPL license (see www.gnu.org).


SPECIAL LICENSE ICONS USED IN MADEXCEPT
---------------------------------------
When using madExcept, some icons are (optionally) linked into your executable
file and used/shown at runtime. Some of these icons are again taken from the
Nuvola icon theme created by David Vignoni. madExcept includes a special
license for these Nuvola icons. madExcept users automatically have a license
to use these Nuvola icons without needing to follow the LGPL, as long as they
are using the icons only in combination with madExcept. If madExcept users want
to use any Nuvola icons outside of the madExcept dialogs, they need to follow
the LGPL license again. The Nuvola icons licensed for madExcept are:

- mail_generic
- button_ok
- button_cancel
- redo
- xmag
- file_save
- file_print
- messagebox_critical
- clanbomber

The licensee must not use any of the mentioned freeware and commercialware
packages in any other product that directly or indirectly competes with the

packages as part of any code library, as source code or in compiled form. The
licensee must not provide any means by which his users could create, modify, or
incorporate any part of the mentioned packages into their own products. The
file "madCHook.dll" may however be distributed together with the licensee's
products.
---------
