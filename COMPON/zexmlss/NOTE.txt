Please note that these components are a hybrid of version 0.0.8 Beta and 0.0.10 Alpha.

The 0.0.8 Beta was modified for REAL48 compatibility and the date/number formatting support was copied back from 0.0.10.


Support can be done via email - support@avemey.com - the guy responded overnight when I contacted him.
