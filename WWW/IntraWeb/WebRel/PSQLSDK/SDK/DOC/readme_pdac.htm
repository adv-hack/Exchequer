<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Pervasive Data Access Components (PDAC) is a set of Visual Component
Library (VCL) components that allow direct access to Pervasive Database
Engines from within the Borland Delphi and C++ Builder Environments.
These components offer a complete replacement for the Borland Database
Engine (BDE), while providing the complete functionality of the BDE.  PDAC
dramatically extends the database development options available to Delphi
and C++ Builder developers.
</p>

<p>
The Pervasive Data Access Components are provided in versions fully integrated
with the Delphi 3, Delphi 4, Delphi 5, Delphi 6, C++ Builder 3,
C++ Builder 4, and C++ Builder 5 development environments.
Compatibility with later versions of the Delphi and C++ Builder development
tools will be made available soon after those products are released
by Borland.  No support is provided or planned for
Delphi 1.0 (16-bit) or 2.0, or C++ Builder 1.0.
</p>

<p>
This update to the PDAC package provides fixes for a number of issues
discovered in the components.
</p>

<hr>
<a name="install"> </a>
<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
To install the PDAC components for Delphi 3-6 and C++ Builder 3-5, download
the following program from <a href="http://www.pervasive.com/developerzone/access_methods/pdac.asp" target="_new">
http://www.pervasive.com/developerzone/access_methods/pdac.asp</a>
</P>

<PRE>PDACSetup.exe</PRE>

<p class=box>
<b>Note:</b> If the Microsoft Windows Installer's "Modify, Repair, Remove" dialog is
observed when running this installer (which should occur if an earlier
"PDAC only" installer has been run), please select "Remove," then run the
new installer again after the old components are removed.

<p>
<a name="passthrough"></a>
<h3>PassThrough property added to PvQuery component</h3>

<p>The property was added addressing 30667.  Setting this property true will force
PDAC to pass the SQL Text directly to the engine, without the pre-parsing
that is ordinarily done to bind parameters.  This is necessary when, for
instance, creating Stored Procedures with parameters.  Use the property
as follows:

<pre>
procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  PvQuery1.SQL.Clear;

  PvQuery1.SQL.Add('CREATE PROCEDURE TestPr(IN :A INTEGER) AS');
  PvQuery1.SQL.Add('BEGIN');
  PvQuery1.SQL.Add('PRINT :A;');
  PvQuery1.SQL.Add('END');

  PvQuery1.PassThrough := True;
  PvQuery1.ExecSQL;
  PvQuery1.PassThrough := False;
end;
</pre>
The PassThrough Property is available at Design Time in the IDE, as well.
<p>

<a name="oemansi"></a>
<h3>TPvDatabase.OEMConversion Property (New)</h3>

<p>This property indicates that the database contains characters encoded
according to the OEM (DOS) code page, and that these characters should be
converted to the ANSI (Windows) code page before use.  The database
remains in the OEM code page, but all reads and writes of character data
are translated by PDAC.

<p>This conversion uses the mapping provided by the Windows OemToCharBuff and
CharToOemBuff functions.  It is important to note that not all characters
are round-trip convertible.  Only the characters present in both the OEM
and ANSI code pages will be preserved in an update.  As a rule of thumb,
most of the alphabetic characters are preserved, but other types of
characters, such as the box-drawing characters, may not be.  For
characters that cannot be preserved exactly, the closest look-alike
character is chosen.  For example, the box-drawing characters are replaced
by plus (+), minus (-), and pipe (|).

<p>Currently, only characters stored in user tables are converted.  Metadata
(stored in DDF files) such as table, column, and file names are not.

<a name="170"><hr></a>
<h2>Notes on 1/19/2000 FTF release (Build 170)</h2>
<p>

This Field Test File release fixes a number of issues and formally adds the
ability to connect via the relational components to a server-located
database without a client-side DSN ("DSN-less connection").
<p>
The <code>pdac_170.exe</code> installation program installs only the PDAC components,
and requires a previous installation of the Pervasive.SQL 2000 SDK.
This installation will install Build 170 components regardless of the
previous version installed; it will update earlier releases, or "back-
date" from later FTFs, if necessary.

<hr>
<a name="bcb5"> </a>
<h2>C++ Builder 5 Support</h2>
<p>
PDAC added full support for Borland C++ Builder 5 in build 170.
<p>
To use PDAC with C++ Builder 5, you need only run the PDAC installation program after installing C++ Builder 5.  The components will be installed on the system and made available on the Palette of the Integrated Development Environment.  The PDAC components must be added to the "include" and "libs" paths of the environment (see instructions <a href="#include">here</a>).
<p class=note>
<b>Note: </b>A default installation of C++ Builder 5 has "Build with Runtime Packages" set on; running applications from the IDE without changing that setting requires that the PDAC "Redist" subdirectory for BCB5 (...\SDK\PDAC\BCB4\Redist) be in the user's PATH environment path.  Pervasive recommends that "Build with Runtime Packages" be left off during development.
<p>


<a name="DSNless"><hr></a>
<h2>DSN-less Connections</h2>
<p>
PDAC's relational components are now able to connect from a client machine
without a DSN or Named Database to a remote server database.  The server
must have a DSN for the database.
<p>
To use the feature:
<p>
Note that a new Property -- 'AliasNameIsConnectionString' -- has been
added to the PvSQLDatabase component. If 'AliasNameIsConnectionString'
is True, then the value in 'AliasName' (or 'DatabaseName,' if 'AliasName'
is empty) is treated as a Connection String.
<p>
<ol>
<li><p>Drop a PvSQLDatabase on a Delphi form.</p>
<li><p>Supply a "made-up" DatabaseName -- it can be anything.</p>
<li><p>Set the new property 'AliasNameIsConnectionString' to True.</p>
<li><p>Set the 'AliasName' property (or the 'DatabaseName,' leaving
    'AliasName' blank) to the Connection String.</p>
<p>
    The Connection String is the complete connection string for ODBC,
    including the DSN on the server and the name of the server.
</p>

<p>
    Example:
<p>
    DRIVER={Pervasive ODBC Client Interface};ServerName=DSLINUX2;ServerDSN=DEMODATA;UID=shenders;PWD=curmudgeon
</pre>
<p class=note>
    <b>Note: </b> There are no quote marks anywhere, and no line breaks. If
    your editor has wrapped the above line, make it a single line in the
    property editor.</p>
<p>
    If a username and password are required, they may be supplied as
    part of the Connection String; if they are not in the Connection
    String, the standard database login dialog will be displayed if the
    'LoginPrompt' property is True.
<p>
<li><p>Set the database to "Connected" and use as usual.</p>
<p>
</ol>

All these steps may be performed at design time or through code at
runtime.

<a name="libs"><hr></a>
<h2>New Library Filenames</h2>
<p>
The filenames of the libraries have been changed since the initial release
of PDAC, to avoid conflicts where multiple Borland environments or
applications are used.  A compiler code -- "D" or "B" for Delphi or C++
Builder, respectively, and a digit (3, 4, or 5) for the version -- has
been added to each library's name to maintain uniqueness.  For example,
"BtvTables.bpl" for Delphi 4 is now "BtvTablesD4.bpl"
<p>
To prevent name conflicts, all PDAC applications developed with he
original libraries should be compiled to use the new versions.  If they
are not re-compiled with the new libraries, applications using the old
libraries should be compiled without the "Build with runtime packages"
option so the libraries are compiled into the application.
<p>

<p class=note><b>Note:</b> The old libraries are not removed by the installation program; they
remain on the disk for use by un-updated applications developed with them.
If they are not needed, they should be deleted.
</p>

<a name="redist"><hr></a>
<h2>"Redist" Subdirectory</h2>
<p>
There is now a "redist" directory for each Borland compiler.  This
directory contains the .DPL or .BPL libraries that must be distruted with
an application compiled with "Build with runtime packages."
<p>
Note that each redist directory also includes .DCP or .BCP files that are
not redistributable except within the licensee's organization to allow
development with derived classes.  These files may not be distributed
outside the licensee's organization; only the .DPL and .BPL packages may
be distributed with applications.

<h2>Adding PDAC to C++ Builder's "Include" and "Library" paths</h2>
<p>
Although the Pervasive Direct Access Component libraries are installed
into all Delphi and C++ Builder IDEs found on your system, it is necessary
to set C++ Builder's "Project Options" to reflect the INCLUDE and LIBRARY
paths for PDAC.  These can be added to the default options, so the steps
are unnecessary for every project using the Pervasive components.  To add
Pervasive Direct Access Components to the INCLUDE and LIBRARY paths in C++
Builder:

<ol>
<li><p>Select Project | Options, and choose the "Directories/Conditionals"
      tab.</p>

<li><p>Add "<installdir>\sdk\pdac\BCB?\include" to the Include Path,
      where <installdir> represents the directory where you installed the
      SDK (C:\PVSW is the default).  Replace the "?" with either 3 or 4,
      depending on the version of C++ Builder you are using.</p>

<li><p>Also add "<installdir>\sdk\pdac\BCB?\lib\" and
      "<installdir>\sdk\pdac\BCB?\lib\dcu" to the "Library Path",
      separated by a semicolon (;).  Replace the "?" with either 3 or 4,
      depending on the version of C++ Builder you are using.</p>

<li><p>Check the Default box (if you want these to be the defaults for all
      projects you create), then click OK to save these options.</p>
</ol>
<p>
After the Include and Library paths are set properly, use the Direct
Access components exactly the same way as the corresponding
Borland components.

<h2>Information on Additional Programs Included with PDAC</h2>

<h3>PDAC2IDE.exe</h3>
<p>
PDAC2IDE.exe, installed in the SDK\PDAC subdirectory, will configure
the Borland Delphi 3/4/5 and C++ Builder 3/4/5 Integrated Development
Environments (IDEs) for the PDAC components.  This utility is run
automatically when the SDK is installed, but can be used at a DOS command
line if new IDEs are installed or if problems occur.
<p>
When installing, there is no need to uninstall first -- any old entries
are automatically deleted prior to installation.  Note that no files are
deleted, copied, or installed; the program simply updates the IDEs for
PDAC.
<p>
The command is used as follows:
<P>
<b>To install PDAC to all Borland IDEs found on a system</b>

<pre>    pdac2ide </pre>
<p>
    This will find all supported Borland environments and make the
    appropriate Registry entries for the components to appear on the
    Palette and be available for use.

<p>
<b>To uninstall PDAC from all Borland IDEs found on a system</b>

<pre>    pdac2ide -u </pre>

<p>
<b>To install or uninstall to/from specific IDEs</b>

<pre>   pdac2ide [-u] [D3] [D4] [D5] [C3] [C4] [C5]</pre>

<p>    One or more IDEs can be listed on the command line.

<p>  The -u parameter runs the uninstall only; if it is not given, PDAC
  will first be uninstalled, then re-installed into each listed IDE.

<p>PDAC2IDE also accepts a -q parameter, for "quiet" mode, that does
  not write to the console; this is useful for inclusion in batch files.


<h3>FixBPR.exe</h3>
<p>
This is a utility to "fix" the C++ Builder .bpr (project) files.  It
replaces references to the old (original PDAC release> library names with
the correct filenames for the new libraries.  The original BPR file is
saved as <project>.bpr.old.
<p>
FixBPR is installed into the PDAC installation directory (c:\pvsw\sdk\pdac,
by default).  It can be run from a DOS or CMD box as follows:
<p>

<pre>    FixBPR <project file name></pre>
<p>
This utility should be run against all C++ Builder projects developed
using the original release of PDAC, so they will build with the correct
libraries.  It is only useful with projects developed with the earlier
PDAC libraries; nothing is added to the BPR files if the old library names
are not found.  It is not necessary to run this utility on the
"default.bpr" files located in the compilers' "bin" directories, as
PDAC2IDE.exe performs that function during installation of PDAC.  <p>


<a name="deploy"><hr></a>
<h2>Deploying PDAC applications</h2>
<p>
See the text file "pdacdepl.txt," located in the ...\SDK\PDAC
subdirectory for complete information on deploying applications developed
with the Pervasive Direct Access Components.


<a name="open"><hr></a>
<h2>Open Issues</h2>
<p>
The first time a C++ Builder application is saved or compiled, the
compiler will open a dialog asking for the location of "PvTables.h".
Select the browse button, browse to the appropriate "include" subdirectory
(beneath the ...\SDK\PDAC\BCB3\, ...\SDK\PDAC\BCB4\, or ...\SDK\PDAC\BCB5\
subdirectory), and select "PvTables.hpp"; repeat this process for any ".h"
files the compiler does not locate.
