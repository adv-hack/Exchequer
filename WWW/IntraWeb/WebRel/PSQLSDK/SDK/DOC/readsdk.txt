1. Welcome

Welcome to the Pervasive.SQL 2000i Software Developer Kit (SDK). This SDK
contains all the necessary software components and tools to develop
Pervasive.SQL database applications.

Service Pack 3 version of the SDK includes the following features:

                                                      manuals

  ADO/OLE DB          The Pervasive OLE DB      Programmer's Guide,
  support             provider marks the        Visual Programmer's
                      next level of             Reference
                      connectivity for
                      developers using          see also OLE DB
                      Microsoft Visual          Readme, Links
                      Studio and other          to Other
                      tools. The Pervasive      Information
                      OLE DB Provider is a
                      rowset provider for
                      use with OLE DB
                      consumers, including
                      ActiveX Data Objects
                      (ADO), Microsoft’s
                      latest high-level data
                      model for Visual
                      Basic, Visual C/C++,
                      and Active Server.

                      The Visual Basic
                      version of the PVideo
                      sample application
                      uses the new OLE DB
                      driver.

  Pervasive Direct    Pervasive Direct          Visual Programmer's
  Access Components   Access Components for     Reference contains
  for Delphi and      Delphi and C++ Builder    installation
  C++ Builder         allows Borland Delphi     instructions
                      and C++ Builder
                      developers to             see also PDAC Readme,
                      seamlessly access a       Links to Other Information
                      Pervasive data source
                      from within either
                      Inprise/Borland
                      development
                      environment. By
                      implementing the
                      TDataSet classes, the
                      data aware components
                      within these
                      environments will be
                      able to take full
                      advantage of a
                      Pervasive data source
                      with higher
                      performance than using
                      the built in access to
                      ODBC via the Borland
                      Database Engine (BDE).

                      The components support
                      direct Btrieve access
                      via the TPvTable
                      class, which
                      implements the TTable
                      database object. A
                      PVideo example is
                      provided in the SDK
                      for both Delphi and
                      C++ Builder 3, 4, and 5.

  JDBC driver and     New interfaces in the     Programmer's Guide,
  Java Class          Pervasive Java Class      API Programmer's
  Library             Library provide           Reference
  Enhancements        support for Binary
                      Large Objects or          see also JDBC Readme
                      BLOBs. BLOB support       
                      allows Java developers
                      the ability to
                      represent large binary
                      files such as GIF,
                      JPEG, and WAV files as
                      Java objects that can
                      then be stored in and
                      retrieved from the
                      database. A Java
                      object serialization
                      example is included.

                      The new Pervasive.SQL
                      JDBC driver gives
                      developers the benefit
                      of a standard data
                      interface, remote data
                      access, and support
                      across all platforms
                      supporting the JVM.
                      Service Pack 2 adds
                      the ability to use
                      JDBC from the
                      Workgroup engine
                      included with the
                      Pervasive.SQL SDK.

  Tuning Interfaces   The Distributed Tuning    API Programmer's
                      Objects (DTO) and         Reference (DTI)
                      Distributed Tuning
                      Interface (DTI) gives     Visual Programmer's
                      developers an             Reference (DTO)
                      unprecedented level of
                      access to information
                      about Pervasive.SQL
                      database engines. The
                      major categories of
                      interfaces supported
                      are:

                         * Connection -
                           establish and
                           discard
                           connections to
                           remote database
                           servers
                         * Configuration -
                           settings for the
                           database engines
                         * Monitoring and
                           Diagnostics -
                           engine statistics
                           and resource
                           usage
                         * Catalog - manage
                           database catalog
                           information
                           (database names,
                           table names,
                           table properties,
                           etc.)

                      DTI is a procedural
                      interface and can be
                      used with C or Delphi.

                      DTO is a COM-based set
                      of objects and can be
                      used with any IDE that
                      supports COM,
                      including Visual
                      Basic, Visual C++,
                      Delphi, and C++ Builder,


  Samples             Service Pack 3 includes
                      the following samples     see the \SAMPLES
