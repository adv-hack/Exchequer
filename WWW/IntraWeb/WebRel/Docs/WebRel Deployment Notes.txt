WEBREL DEPLOYMENT NOTES
========================
 Date: 03 March 2005

========================

1) Once the WebRel project is built, FTP the WebRel.dll file to:

	ftp://mdtadmin@www.exchequer.secure.com

You will have to supply the MDTADMIN password for this to be successful.


2) Open a mobile desktop to continue:

	http://www.exchequer-secure.com/mdt/

Login with MDTADMIN username and the correct password.


3) Once logged in, you will need to stop the w3svc publishing service by issuing the following instruction at the command prompt:

	net stop w3svc

This will stop the WWW services.


4) Copy the uploaded file from c:\source\xxxxxxx (Wherever you uploaded it to) to:

	c:\inetpub\exwebrel (Live WebRel) or
	c:\inetpub\exwrtest (test webrel)

*** making sure that you backed up the original WebRel.dll file first! ***


5) Restart the WWW services by issuing the following instruction at the command prompt:

	net start w3svc

This will restart the WWW services.


6) To test, visit:

	https://www.exchequer-secure.com/wrscripts/webrel.dll/webrel     (Live) or
	https://www.exchequer-secure.com/wrtest/webrel.dll/webrel        (Test).

N.B. - when accessing the test site (if you are using the test site), you may be asked to authenticate to Exchequer-Secure using the MDTADMIN login. I believe this is due to the setup of the test site. The live site should not pop up this authentication dialog and if it does, there is likely a problem.
