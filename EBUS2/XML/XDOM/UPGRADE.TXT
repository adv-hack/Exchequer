How to update your old Delphi code
----------------------------------

1. First you will have to uninstall the old 
   components as described below.
4. Install the components from 'XDOM_2_3.pas' 
   as described in 'readme.html'.
5. Reload your projects and remove each reference
   to XDOM in the uses clauses of a unit and
   replace it by a reference to XDOM_2_3, if
   that is not done automatically by the Delphi
   Shell.
6. Adjust your source code. For a detailed 
   documentation of all classes see 'manual.txt'. 
   

How to uninstall old XDOM components

   components, and hit the 'remove' button.

5. Close the package window, and next confirm
   that the modifications should be saved.
