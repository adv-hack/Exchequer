BUGS
----

- Since the current XML specification's VC "Element 
  Valid" (XML 1.0, § 3) is faulty, its implementation
  probably needs to be changed, when the bug in the 
  XML specification is fixed.
- Namespace-aware TdomEntityDeclaration and
  TdomEntity nodes have not been tested.
- A few minor bugs and problems are indicated in 
  the source code by 'xxx' together with a brief
  comment.


TO DO
-----

- review the implementation of namespaces for
  possible improvements (performance, memory use).
- review the code for private methods to be moved
  to protected.
- save locator information on nodes.
- save reference to node on TXmlParserError.
- Introduce a special list class for use with 
  TdomDocument.IDs
- Revise the code() methods to conform to James
  Clark's "Canonical XML" 
  (see "http://www.jclark.com/xml/canonxml.html").
- Events on DOM tree modifications such as 
  OnBeforeRemoveNode, ...
- change type of RefNode parameter of some parser 
  methods from TdomNode into a more specific type.
- optimize parsing speed.
- write more code examples.
- write a FAQ
