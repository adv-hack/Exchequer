Originally the Gutters & Ladders Re-order quantity. "Pack size round-up".

Now genericised and is an Enterprise Plug-In


A pretty simple plug-in, acting upon the re-order quantity from the re-order screen or the
Auto-Set button. 

Set the pack size on the the User Def4 field for the stock item. The plug-in will use this to
round up the re-order quantity to a quantity that is equal to the total number of items in the 
next nearest pack.

So, to give an example,

Pack size 12 items

Re-order 22 items, therefore

Re-order quantity will be 24. 

The plug-in always rounds upto the next pack multiplier.

There are no setup or configuration files, just add entgnlro to the EntCustm.Ini file.
